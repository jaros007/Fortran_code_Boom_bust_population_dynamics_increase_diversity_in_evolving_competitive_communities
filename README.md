# Fortran_code_Boom_bust_population_dynamics_increase_diversity_in_evolving_competitive_communities
Fortran codes for discrete generation model of competing individual populations with boom-bust population dynamics.
Needs rand.dat file with a seed, which can be any negative integer number, e.g. -1987981, for random number generator.
Alternatively, the read operation can be commented out and the seed can be specified in the program itself.
